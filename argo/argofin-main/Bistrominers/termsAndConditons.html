            <p>
                1.1 This client agreement (the “Agreement”)is entered by and between ARGO INVESTMENTS (the “Company”) and the person and/or legal entity that has applied to open a trading account at the Company’s trading platform (the “Client”), according to the terms and conditions detailed in this agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                1.2 Trade Investments (“Trading”), means that a contract is being created which gives the Client the right to estimate the direction of change in price of an underlying asset, within a certain time frame determined by the Company. This trading instrument is different from trading in trading in ‘options’ in a traditional way, since there is a fixed return that is determined at the outset of the trade, such as: there is usually no Stop-Loss order and other features.
            </p>
            <h4>2. The Trading Account.</h4>
            <p>

The license is personal, non-transferable and is for persons who are older than 18 years old (or older legal age, if the law applicable to the Client’s jurisdictions requires a higher legal age) and subject to this Agreement. The Client will not transfer, assign, or enable other to make any use of the license, and/or give the Clients access codes to the Trading Account to anyone. Any damage caused to the Client, the Company and any third party due to breach of this Agreement by Client, shall be under the Client’s sole responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.3 Activation of the Trading Account – The Account will be activated by the Company as soon as the Company has identified the funds credited by the Client to the Trading Account. The Company may activate the Trading Account and permit trading in the Trading Account subject to such limitations, and to the satisfaction of such further requirements as the Company may impose. Where a Trading Account is not activated or is frozen, no funds held by the Company in respect of that Trading Account may be transferred back or to any other person until the Company is satisfied that all Applicable Regulations have been complied with.
            </p>
            <p>

The predetermined amounts are a derivative of the collateral invested in the transaction by the Client, and will be published in the Trading Platform.
